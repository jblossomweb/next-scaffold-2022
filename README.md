This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### React Pages

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/views/HomePage`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
The Route for this page is defined by `src/pages/index.ts`.

#### API Routes

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

An example can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/ping](http://localhost:3000/api/ping).

This endpoint's controller can be edited in `src/api/controllers/PingController`.
The Route for this endpoint is defined by `src/pages/api/ping.ts`.
